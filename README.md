## Features

- Users can select any day between Monday to Friday and view the time slots.
- Users can see how many open spots are remaining for each day.
- Open time slots appear empty with and "Add" button to allow the user to create a new appointment.
- New appointments require student name to be entered and an interviewer to be selected.
- After being saved, the new appointment is visible to the user in the schedule.
- Existing appointments can be edited to allow the user to update the student name and/or select a different interviewer.
- Users can delete existing appointments and are served a confirmation before any destructive action is taken.
- If an error occurs while saving or deleting an appointment, the user will be served an error message.
- Closing the error message returns the user to the edit state if the error occurred while saving an appointment or to the schedule view if it occurred while attempting to delete.
- User data is persisted as the application communicates with an API server through HTTP requests (via JSON format), using a PostgreSQL database.
